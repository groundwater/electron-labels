> Experimenting with labels for triaging issues

# Triage

Triage does not attempt to validate any of the incoming issues.
Rather, triage quickly assigns a broad categorization to allow reviewers to focus on the issues type of interest.

- `triage/bugreport`
- `triage/offtopic`
- `triage/request`

# Review

Review labels represent the result of a reviewer who spends anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours on a triaged issue.

- `review/blocked/needs-info`
- `review/blocked/needs-EPM`
- `review/verified/would-patch` for bugs that we would accept patches for
- `review/verified/would-merge` for features that we would accept PRs for

# Bugs

Bugs can be sub-categorized.

- `bug/crash`
- `bug/behavior`

# Features

Features can be sub-categorized.

- `feature/breaking`
- `feature/add`
- `feature/deprecation`

# Offtopic

Allow for offtopic discussion, but give it a clear label so folks working on features/bus can choose to ignore.

- `offtopic/discuss`
- `offtopic/question`
- `offtopic/announce`
